**CONTEXT:** As an e-commerce warehouse provider, it's vital to keep track of the performance of our product portfolio. Recently, we've observed an increase in customer churn, leading to revenue losses.

**OBJECTIVE:** The objective of this analysis is to understand product performance across different geographic markets in order to identify the drivers behind the churn phenomenon, enabling us to implement targeted interventions for retention using data from December 2018 to December 2019.
